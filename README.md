The FreshFruity web application was developed to address the growing need for a convenient and efficient way to purchase fresh fruits online. Traditional grocery shopping often poses challenges such as limited fruit variety, inconsistent quality, long wait times, and inconvenient store hours. These issues highlight the need for an online solution that can streamline the purchasing process and ensure high-quality, fresh produce is accessible to all consumers.
